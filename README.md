<h1>Crystal Collector Game</h1>
An number game styled by HTML/CSS and powered by jQuery code.
<br /><br/>
<b>Instructions:</b>
There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.<br/>
The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.<br/><br/>

When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. <br/><br/>


Your game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.<br/>
When they do click one, update the player's score counter.<br/><br/>


The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.<br/>
The player loses if their score goes above the random number.<br/><br/>

The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.<br/><br/>


When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.<br/><br/>


The app should show the number of games the player wins and loses. To that end, do not refresh the page as a means to restart the game.<br/><br/>
